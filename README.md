🌟 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!
This repo contains a collection of ML projects I’ve worked on while learning and applying concepts across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, NLP, deep learning, and data analysis.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, showcase practical implementations, and provide clean, reproducible code for others to learn from.
